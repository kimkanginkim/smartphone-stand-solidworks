# 📱 Smartphone Stand Design & SolidWorks CAD Practice

This repository showcases both a team-based design project and individual CAD modeling practice from the course *Engineering Drawing (공학제도)* at Ewha Womans University.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 1. Smartphone Stand Design Project
As a team, we designed a practical and user-friendly smartphone stand using **SolidWorks**. The design process included:

- Ideation and sketching
- 3D modeling with SolidWorks
- 3D printing of the prototype
- Presentation and peer feedback session

📄 See [`smartphone_stand_ppt.pdf`](./smartphone_stand_ppt.pdf) for the final presentation.

### 2. SolidWorks Practice Models
To build proficiency in CAD, I completed several individual modeling tasks involving common mechanical parts.

Each part includes:
- `.SLDPRT` SolidWorks file
- A corresponding PDF blueprint

📁 See files under the [`SolidWorks practice_model`](./SolidWorks%20practice_model) directory.

| Part Name                | File Name                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Simple Base Part        | `SLDpractice.SLDPRT`                |
| Brace                   | `practice1_brace.SLDPRT`            |
| L-Bracket               | `practice2_L-bracket.SLDPRT`        |
| Cylinder Support        | `practice3_cylinder support.SLDPRT` |
| Pillow Block            | `practice4_pillow block.SLDPRT`     |
| Pulley                  | `practice5_pulley.SLDPRT`           |
